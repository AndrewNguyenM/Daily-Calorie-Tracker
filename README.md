# Daily Calories Tracker
The Daily Calories Tracker is a Python application designed to help users track their daily caloric intake. It calculates the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Active Metabolic Rate (AMR) based on user inputs such as gender, height, weight, age, and activity level. Users can then log their daily food intake to monitor their remaining caloric allowance.

# Features
Calculates BMR and AMR for both males and females.
Allows users to input their daily food consumption in calories.
Tracks the remaining caloric allowance for the day.
Saves user data for future reference.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x,
File handling in Python for data storage.

# Installation and Setup
To use the Daily Calories Tracker, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Run the script from your terminal or Python IDE.
Usage
Upon starting the program, users are prompted to identify as a 'New' or 'Returning' user.

New users will go through the BMR and AMR calculation process.
Returning users can enter their daily food intake to track their remaining calories.

# How It Works
The program calculates the BMR based on the Harris-Benedict equation.
The AMR is calculated by multiplying the BMR with an activity factor.
Daily food intake is subtracted from the AMR to give the remaining caloric allowance.
